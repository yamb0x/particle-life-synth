# Issue #04: Collision Radius vs Particle Size Relationship

## Description
The collision radius and particle size parameters don't have a clear visual relationship. Particles can overlap even with collision radius set, and particle size changes don't affect collision detection.

## Current State
- Particle size is purely visual
- Collision radius is a separate physics parameter
- No visual indicator of collision radius
- Particles can visually overlap despite collision settings

## Expected Behavior
- Collision radius should have some relationship to particle size
- Option to link collision radius to particle size (e.g., collision = size * multiplier)
- Visual feedback showing effective collision area
- Clear documentation of the relationship

## Areas Affected
1. **SimpleParticleSystem.js**
   - Collision detection logic
   - Particle size vs collision radius

2. **MainUI.js**
   - Particle size slider
   - Collision radius slider
   - Missing visual feedback

3. **PresetModal.js**
   - Physics settings organization

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Set particle size to 10
2. Set collision radius to 30
3. Observe particles can still visually overlap
4. Change particle size - collision behavior doesn't change
5. No clear visual indication of actual collision boundaries

## Solution Options
1. Add "Link to particle size" checkbox for collision radius
2. Show collision radius as semi-transparent circle in debug mode
3. Implement collision radius = particle size * multiplier option
4. Add visual indicator or explanation in UI
5. Consider minimum collision radius based on particle size

## Priority
Low - Functional but confusing UX that needs clarification.

## Resolution
**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED (2025-07-12)

**Solution Implemented**: 
Added clarifying help text to the UI controls:

1. **Particle Size control**: Added "Visual size only (doesn't affect physics)"
2. **Collision Radius control**: Added "Distance for collision forces (independent of visual size)"
3. **Social Radius control**: Added "Distance for attraction/repulsion forces"

This makes it clear that:
- Particle size is purely visual and doesn't affect collision detection
- Collision radius determines when particles start pushing each other away
- The two parameters are intentionally independent to allow flexible configurations
- Users can have large visual particles with small collision radius or vice versa

The help text uses the design system's font-size-xs and text-secondary color for consistency.
