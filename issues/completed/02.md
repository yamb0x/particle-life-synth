# Issue #02: Trails Toggle Not Working Properly

## Description
The trails checkbox in the main UI appears to not affect the visual rendering consistently. The trail effect may be overridden by preset loading or not properly synchronized.

## Current State
- Trails checkbox can be toggled but effect is inconsistent
- Blur value changes work but trails on/off doesn't always reflect
- Preset loading may override the trail setting

## Expected Behavior
- When trails are disabled, canvas should clear completely each frame
- When trails are enabled, blur effect should create motion trails
- Setting should persist across preset changes unless explicitly set by preset

## Areas Affected
1. **SimpleParticleSystem.js**
   - `render()` method trail implementation
   - Trail enabled flag handling

2. **MainUI.js**
   - Trails checkbox event handler
   - Preset loading synchronization

3. **PresetModal.js**
   - Trail setting in preset data

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the application
2. Toggle "Enable Trails" checkbox off
3. Observe particles still leaving trails
4. Load different preset
5. Trail setting may not match checkbox state

## Root Cause Analysis
- Need to verify the render loop properly checks `trailEnabled` flag
- Ensure blur value is properly applied only when trails are enabled
- Check preset loading doesn't override UI state incorrectly

## Solution
1. Debug the render method trail logic
2. Ensure proper state synchronization
3. Add explicit canvas clear when trails disabled
4. Verify preset loading respects current UI state

## Priority
Medium - Affects visual quality and user control over aesthetics.

## Resolution
**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED (2025-07-12)

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added explicit `globalAlpha = 1.0` and `globalCompositeOperation = 'source-over'` when trails are disabled
- This ensures the canvas is fully cleared each frame when trails are off
- Previously, the globalAlpha might have been left at the blur value from a previous frame

The trails toggle now works correctly - when disabled, the canvas clears completely each frame.
