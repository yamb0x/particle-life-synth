# Issue #03: Species Color Updates Don't Reflect in Real-Time

## Description
When changing species colors in the configuration modal, the particle colors in the main visualization don't update immediately. Requires applying/saving the preset for changes to take effect.

## Current State
- Color picker changes update the preset data
- Visual feedback in color picker works
- Particle colors only update after apply/save
- No real-time preview of color changes

## Expected Behavior
- Changing a species color should immediately update particles
- Real-time visual feedback as colors are adjusted
- Similar to how force relationships update in real-time

## Areas Affected
1. **ColorPicker.js**
   - onChange callback implementation

2. **PresetModal.js**
   - Color change handling
   - Real-time updates to particle system

3. **SimpleParticleSystem.js**
   - Species color update method
   - Particle color references

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open configuration modal
2. Go to Species tab
3. Click on a color picker
4. Change the color using sliders
5. Observe particles don't change color until "Apply" is clicked

## Solution
1. Add real-time update callback from ColorPicker to PresetModal
2. Update particle system species colors on change
3. Ensure particles reference current species color
4. Maintain performance with debounced updates if needed

## Priority
Medium - Affects user experience and immediate visual feedback.

## Resolution
**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED (2025-07-12)

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added real-time update to particle system species colors in the ColorPicker onChange callback
- When a color is changed in the modal, it now immediately updates `this.particleSystem.species[index].color`
- This provides instant visual feedback as particles will render with the new color on the next frame

Species color changes now reflect immediately in the visualization without needing to apply/save the preset.
