# Issue #09: Floating Configuration Panel

## Description
Convert the configuration panel from a modal with darkened background to a floating, draggable window that allows users to see and interact with particles while making adjustments.

## Current Behavior
- Configuration panel opens as a modal with dark overlay
- Cannot see particle behavior while adjusting settings
- Modal blocks all interaction with the canvas

## Desired Behavior
- Floating window that can be dragged around the screen
- No background overlay - particles remain fully visible
- Can interact with both the configuration panel and see real-time particle changes
- Window should remember its last position (optional enhancement)

## Technical Requirements
1. Remove modal overlay
2. Implement draggable window functionality
3. Add window header with drag handle
4. Ensure z-index layering works properly
5. Consider adding minimize/maximize functionality

## Benefits
- Real-time visual feedback while adjusting settings
- Better workflow for fine-tuning particle behaviors
- More professional application feel

## Priority
High - This significantly improves the user experience and workflow

## Status
Open
