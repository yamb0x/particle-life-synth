# Issue #12: Glow Effect Performance Optimization

## Description
While the glow effect implementation works well, there may be room for performance optimization, especially when all species have high intensity glow effects.

## Current Implementation
- Multiple glow layers rendered per species
- Using `lighter` composite mode for glow layers
- Separate rendering passes for glow and core particles

## Potential Optimizations
1. **Batch similar glow settings**: Group species with identical glow settings
2. **LOD system**: Reduce glow layers at high particle counts
3. **Canvas caching**: Pre-render glow patterns for common configurations
4. **GPU acceleration**: Investigate WebGL for glow rendering
5. **Dynamic quality**: Auto-adjust glow quality based on FPS

## Performance Targets
- Maintain 60 FPS with 1000 particles and full glow
- No stuttering when changing glow settings
- Smooth performance on mid-range devices

## Testing Needed
- Profile current performance bottlenecks
- Test on various devices and browsers
- Measure impact of different glow intensities
- Compare performance with/without glow

## Priority
Low - Current performance is acceptable, this is for future optimization

## Status
Open - Document for future reference
