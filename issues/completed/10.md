# Issue #10: Copy/Paste Settings Feature

## Description
Add a "Copy Settings" button to the main floating UI and a "Paste Settings" button to the configuration panel to enable easy transfer of experimental parameter tweaks.

## User Story
As a user, I want to:
1. Experiment with parameters using the main UI sliders
2. Click "Copy Settings" to capture the current state
3. Open the configuration panel
4. Click "Paste Settings" to apply my experimental values
5. Save as a new preset or update existing one

## Implementation Details

### Main UI Changes
- Add "Copy Settings" button (near minimize button or in controls section)
- When clicked, capture all current particle system parameters
- Store in clipboard or temporary memory
- Show visual feedback (e.g., "Settings Copied!" toast)

### Configuration Panel Changes
- Add "Paste Settings" button (prominent location, maybe near Save)
- When clicked, apply copied settings to all relevant fields
- Update UI to reflect pasted values
- Show visual feedback (e.g., "Settings Pasted!")

### Technical Considerations
- Store settings in a standardized format (same as preset export)
- Include all parameters: physics, visual, forces, species settings
- Handle edge cases (no settings copied, incompatible species count, etc.)

## Benefits
- Streamlines the workflow from experimentation to preset creation
- Reduces manual copying of values between panels
- Encourages experimentation without fear of losing good configurations

## Priority
High - This is a key workflow improvement
