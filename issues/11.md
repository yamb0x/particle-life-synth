# Issue #11: Preset Selector in Configuration Panel

## Description
Add a preset dropdown selector to the header of the configuration panel to allow easy switching between presets without closing the panel.

## Current Behavior
- Must close configuration panel to select a different preset
- Workflow is interrupted when comparing or editing multiple presets
- No easy way to see how different presets are configured

## Desired Behavior
- Preset dropdown in configuration panel header (similar to main UI)
- Selecting a preset loads it into the configuration panel
- Can quickly switch between presets to compare settings
- Stays synchronized with main UI preset selector

## Implementation Details

### UI Changes
- Add dropdown selector to preset modal header
- Position next to preset name input field
- Include all presets (built-in and custom)
- Show current preset as selected

### Functionality
- On preset selection:
  - Load preset data into all configuration fields
  - Update preset name field
  - Update species list and all tabs
  - Mark as "changed" if modifications exist
- Handle unsaved changes warning when switching

### Synchronization
- Keep in sync with main UI preset selector
- Update both when preset is changed in either location

## Benefits
- Faster workflow when working with multiple presets
- Easy comparison of preset configurations
- Better preset management experience

## Priority
Medium - Important UX improvement but not blocking

## Status
Open
