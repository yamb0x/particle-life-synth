# Audio Stability Improvements for Particle-Life-Synth

## Overview

Based on research into Web Audio API stability issues and granular synthesis best practices, this document outlines comprehensive improvements to eliminate audio glitches, chopping, and instability in the particle-life-synth system.

## Root Causes of Audio Instability

### Research Findings
1. **Buffer Management Issues**: Poor buffering can cause audio dropouts and glitches
2. **Excessive Node Creation**: Creating too many AudioBufferSourceNodes causes performance degradation
3. **Rate Limiting Problems**: Insufficient rate limiting leads to system overload
4. **Clipping and Distortion**: Audio values exceeding Â±1 cause harsh digital distortion
5. **Timing Precision**: Imprecise scheduling causes audio artifacts
6. **Memory Management**: Garbage collection can cause audio thread interruptions

### Specific Issues Identified
- **ScriptProcessorNode Usage**: Deprecated and causes stability issues (should use AudioWorklet)
- **Lack of Compression**: No dynamics control leads to clipping
- **Insufficient Lookahead**: Real-time scheduling without buffering causes dropouts
- **No Emergency Modes**: System doesn't adapt to performance constraints

## Comprehensive Stability Solutions

### 1. StabilizedAudioEngine (`StabilizedAudioEngine.js`)

#### Key Improvements
- **Conservative Master Volume**: Set to -3dB to prevent clipping
- **Mandatory Compressor Chain**: Dynamics compression + brick-wall limiting
- **Adaptive Buffer Sizing**: Larger buffers for stability vs latency trade-off
- **Emergency Mode System**: Automatic quality reduction under load
- **Enhanced Performance Monitoring**: Real-time stability metrics

#### Implementation Details
```javascript
// Research-based compressor settings
this.compressor.threshold.value = -12; // Conservative threshold
this.compressor.knee.value = 6;        // Smooth compression curve
this.compressor.ratio.value = 6;       // Moderate compression ratio

// Brick wall limiter (research recommendation)
this.limiter.threshold.value = -1;     // Just below clipping
this.limiter.ratio.value = 20;         // High ratio for limiting
```

#### Stability Features
- **Grain Rate Limiting**: Per-species rate limits to prevent overload
- **Global Grain Limits**: Maximum 128 simultaneous grains with adaptive reduction
- **Lookahead Scheduling**: 100ms lookahead for smooth grain timing
- **Stability Monitoring**: Real-time detection of audio issues with warnings

### 2. StabilizedGrainScheduler (`StabilizedGrainScheduler.js`)

#### Advanced Scheduling Features
- **Buffered Scheduling**: Pre-schedule grains with 100ms lookahead
- **Predictive Particle Tracking**: Smooth audio through position prediction
- **Priority-Based Processing**: Process most important grains first
- **Adaptive Rate Control**: Automatically adjust scheduling rate based on performance

#### Performance Optimizations
```javascript
// Adaptive scheduling based on system load
adaptSchedulingRate() {
  const currentLoad = this.audioEngine.performanceMetrics?.audioLoad || 0;
  
  if (currentLoad > 0.8) {
    this.currentSchedulingRate = Math.max(20, targetRate * 0.5);
  } else if (currentLoad > 0.6) {
    this.currentSchedulingRate = Math.max(30, targetRate * 0.75);
  }
}
```

#### Stability Controls
- **Grain Queue Management**: Buffered grain processing with overflow protection
- **Per-Species Limiting**: Individual rate limits for each species
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of grain processing failures
- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive monitoring of scheduling performance

### 3. Enhanced GranularSynth Integration

#### Stability-Focused Grain Scheduling
```javascript
scheduleGrainOptimized(grainParams, effectiveSize) {
  // Enhanced rate limiting with stability focus
  const adaptiveInterval = this.calculateAdaptiveInterval();
  if (now - this.lastGrainTime < adaptiveInterval) {
    return false; // Rate limited
  }
  
  // Check grain capacity with stability buffer
  const stabilityBuffer = Math.floor(this.maxGrainsPerSpecies * 0.1);
  if (this.activeGrains.size >= (this.maxGrainsPerSpecies - stabilityBuffer)) {
    this.cleanupFinishedGrains();
    return false; // At capacity
  }
}
```

#### Improvements Made
- **Return Success Status**: Methods now return boolean success indicators
- **Proactive Cleanup**: Remove finished grains before hitting limits
- **Adaptive Intervals**: Dynamic rate limiting based on system performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks for grain creation

## Performance Modes for Different Hardware

### Performance Mode Settings
```javascript
performanceModes = {
  'maximum': {
    maxGrains: 256,
    schedulingRate: 120,
    minGrainInterval: 0.005,
    adaptiveScheduling: false
  },
  'balanced': {
    maxGrains: 128,
    schedulingRate: 60,
    minGrainInterval: 0.01,
    adaptiveScheduling: true
  },
  'efficient': {
    maxGrains: 64,
    schedulingRate: 30,
    minGrainInterval: 0.02,
    adaptiveScheduling: true
  }
}
```

### Automatic Performance Adaptation
- **Load-Based Adaptation**: Automatically reduce quality under high CPU load
- **Emergency Mode**: Drastic reduction when system is overwhelmed
- **Graceful Recovery**: Gradually restore quality when performance improves

## Buffer Management Strategies

### Lookahead Buffering
- **100ms Lookahead**: Grains scheduled ahead of time for smooth playback
- **Scheduling Buffer**: Queue of upcoming grains with priority processing
- **Predictive Positioning**: Use particle velocity to predict future positions

### Memory Management
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse grain parameter objects to avoid GC
- **Buffer Cleanup**: Proactive cleanup of finished audio nodes
- **Memory Monitoring**: Track buffer utilization and memory pressure

## Integration with Existing System

### Backwards Compatibility
- All existing GranularSynth API methods maintained
- Enhanced methods return success status for better error handling

### Integration Steps
1. **StabilizedAudioEngine**: Replace AudioEngine for stability
2. **StabilizedGrainScheduler**: Add centralized grain scheduling
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Update calling code to handle return values
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Integrate stability metrics into UI

### Usage Example
```javascript
// Initialize stabilized system
import { getStabilizedAudioEngine } from './StabilizedAudioEngine.js';
import { StabilizedGrainScheduler } from './StabilizedGrainScheduler.js';

const audioEngine = getStabilizedAudioEngine();
await audioEngine.initialize();

// Set performance mode based on device capabilities
audioEngine.setGranularPerformanceMode('balanced');

// Create grain scheduler
const grainScheduler = new StabilizedGrainScheduler(audioEngine, 128);
grainScheduler.setPerformanceMode('balanced');
grainScheduler.start();

// Monitor stability
audioEngine.onStabilityWarning = (warning) => {
  console.warn(`Audio stability warning: ${warning.type}`);
  // Adjust performance settings if needed
};
```

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Stability Metrics

- **Glitch Count**: Track audio dropouts and processing errors
- **Buffer Utilization**: Monitor scheduling buffer efficiency
- **Grain Statistics**: Active grains, dropped grains, scheduling success rate

### Real-Time Monitoring
```javascript
// Get comprehensive stability report
const report = audioEngine.getStabilityReport();
console.log(`Audio Load: ${report.audioLoad * 100}%`);
console.log(`Active Grains: ${report.activeGrains}`);
console.log(`Emergency Mode: ${report.emergencyMode}`);
console.log(`Stability Score: ${report.stabilityMetrics.stability}`);
```
