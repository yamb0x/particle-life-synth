# Audio Feature Removal Summary

## Date: August 10, 2025

### What Was Removed

1. **Complete Audio Folder** (`src/audio/`)
   - AudioEngine.js
   - AudioSystem.js  
   - GranularSynth.js
   - EnhancedGranularSynth.js
   - StabilizedAudioEngine.js
   - StabilizedGrainScheduler.js
   - IntelligentSampler.js
   - GrainOrganizer.js
   - SampleManager.js
   - DecoupledAudioBridge.js
   - SamplingArea.js

2. **UI Components**
   - LeftPanel.js (entire audio control panel)
   - SamplingControlUI.js
   - SpeciesAudioControl.js
   - ParameterMapping.js (synth mapping system)

3. **Test Files**
   - All test-audio-*.html files
   - Granular Particle Sim Audio Build.html

4. **From main.js**
   - Audio system initialization
   - Left panel creation and management
   - Sampling area mouse handlers
   - Audio-related keyboard shortcuts ([ and ])
   - Audio system mute toggle

5. **From MainUI.js**
   - Synth assignment system
   - Left panel update calls
   - Audio-related keyboard shortcut handling
   - saveSynthAssignments() and loadSynthAssignments() methods

6. **From PresetModal.js**
   - updateSynthAssignmentsFromUI() method
   - Synth assignment references

### What Was Preserved

✅ **Complete visual particle system** - No changes to physics or rendering
✅ **Preset system** - All preset loading/saving functionality intact
✅ **Firebase integration** - Cloud sync for presets still works
✅ **User settings** - All visual settings preserved
✅ **Right control panel** - All particle controls remain functional
✅ **Keyboard shortcuts** - C, V, R, M keys still work (without audio)

### Clean Architecture Result

The codebase is now focused purely on the visual particle simulation without any audio dependencies. This provides a clean foundation for future development, whether that's:
- Building a proper JUCE VST plugin as originally planned
- Keeping it as a pure visual experience
- Integrating different audio approaches in the future

The removal was complete and surgical - the particle system continues to work exactly as before, just without the audio layer that had grown too complex for a web-based implementation.
